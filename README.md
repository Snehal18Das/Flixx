My first major project - a step towards conquering Vanilla JS! 
This is a full-fledged Movie Database, where you can find info about any movie or series you want! You can browse through categories, or simply search for your favorite show!
p.s - gonna add 'similar to this' feature soon. Also need to fix some bugs like 'bg of details page extending downwards', and some minor others. 
Feel free to suggest modifications!
